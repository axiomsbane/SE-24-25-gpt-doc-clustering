1. Project Overview
Title: Clustering Documents and Visualization of Embedding Vector Space

Objective: To generate embeddings for a set of documents using OpenAI's GPT, cluster the documents based on their embeddings, and visualize the clusters in a reduced-dimensional space. Additionally, calculate and verify the cosine similarity between documents within and across clusters.
