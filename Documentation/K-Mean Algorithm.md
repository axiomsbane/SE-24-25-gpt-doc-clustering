## 1. Project Overview

**Title:** Clustering Documents and Visualization of Embedding Vector Space

**Objective:** To generate embeddings for a set of documents using OpenAI's GPT, cluster the documents based on their embeddings, and visualize the clusters in a reduced-dimensional space. Additionally, calculate and verify the cosine similarity between documents within and across clusters.

### **Clustering**
- **Description of the clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means).**

#### **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for **clustering** data points into **K distinct groups** based on their similarity. It is a **centroid-based clustering algorithm** that iteratively refines cluster assignments to minimize intra-cluster variance. K-Means is widely used in **data mining, pattern recognition, image segmentation, and document clustering**.

#### **Working Principle of K-Means**
The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Select **K** (the number of clusters to form).
   - Randomly initialize **K centroids** in the feature space.

2. **Cluster Assignment:**
   - Assign each data point to the closest centroid based on a distance metric (typically **Euclidean distance**).
   - This forms K clusters where each data point belongs to the nearest centroid.

3. **Centroid Update:**
   - Compute the **new centroid** for each cluster by taking the mean of all data points in that cluster.
   - The centroid is now repositioned at the center of its cluster.

4. **Reassignment & Convergence:**
   - Repeat **steps 2 and 3** until the centroids no longer change significantly or a stopping condition is met (e.g., max iterations reached, minimal movement of centroids).

#### **Mathematical Representation**

Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ be the dataset with $n$ points, where each $x_i$ is a vector in $d$-dimensional space. Let $C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k\}$ be the set of cluster centroids.

- **Cluster Assignment Step:**
Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid using:

$$
C(i) = \arg \min_{j \in \{1,2,...,K\}} || x_i - c_j ||^2
$$

where $|| x_i - c_j ||^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance.

- **Centroid Update Step:** The centroid of each cluster is updated as:

$$
c_j = \frac{1}{|S_j|} \sum_{x_i \in S_j} x_i
$$

where $S_j$ is the set of points assigned to cluster $j$.


#### **Choosing the Number of Clusters (K)**
Since K-Means requires **K** to be predefined, several methods help determine the optimal value:
1. **Elbow Method:**
   - Plot the **within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)** vs. K.
   - The optimal K is where the "elbow" (sharp bend) appears.

2. **Silhouette Score:**
   - Measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
   - A higher silhouette score indicates a well-separated cluster structure.

#### **Advantages of K-Means**
- **Scalability:** Efficient for large datasets.
- **Fast Convergence:** Typically converges in a few iterations.
- **Ease of Interpretation:** Produces distinct, non-overlapping clusters.

#### **Applications of K-Means**
- **Document Clustering:** Grouping similar text documents.
- **Image Segmentation:** Clustering pixels based on color similarity.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual data points in a dataset.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Categorizing customers based on purchasing behavior.
